# Youtube Playback Times

Youtube Playback Times is a Google Chrome extension that prepends the video's duration to
your Youtube bookmarks.

If you ever find yourself bookmarking lots of videos to watch later, this extension is for you!

You can manage your available time better by selecting videos from your bookmarks that correspond
to the time you have available for viewing.

## Installation and Use

You will need a Google API key to use this extension. Unfortunately video durations are behind Google's API.

[See this link for an overview of the Google API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)
